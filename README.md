# Discussion-Session-the-Depths-of-Data

This project for a workshop provides an in-depth guide to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The primary focus is on using **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization, and **Scikit-learn** to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on their usage patterns.

## Project Overview

In this project, the telecom churn dataset is analyzed to uncover valuable insights and build a model for predicting churn. The project is divided into two main notebooks:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas**
2. **Machine Learning Tutorial for Beginners**

Both notebooks aim to provide hands-on knowledge for analyzing data and using machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including their demographics, usage patterns, and service subscriptions. The key columns in the dataset are:

- **State**: Customer's state (e.g., California, Ohio).
- **Account length**: The number of months the customer has been with the telecom company.
- **Area code**: The area code of the customer’s phone number.
- **International plan**: Whether the customer has an international calling plan (Yes/No).
- **Voice mail plan**: Whether the customer subscribes to a voicemail plan (Yes/No).
- **Number vmail messages**: The number of voicemail messages the customer has.
- **Total day minutes**: Total minutes used during the day.
- **Total day calls**: Total number of calls made during the day.
- **Total day charge**: Total charge for the day.
- **Total eve minutes**: Total minutes used during the evening.
- **Total eve calls**: Total number of calls made during the evening.
- **Total eve charge**: Total charge for the evening.
- **Total night minutes**: Total minutes used during the night.
- **Total night calls**: Total number of calls made during the night.
- **Total night charge**: Total charge for the night.
- **Total intl minutes**: Total minutes used for international calls.
- **Total intl calls**: Total number of international calls.
- **Total intl charge**: Total charge for international calls.
- **Customer service calls**: The number of calls made to customer service by the customer.
- **Churn**: Whether the customer has left the company (True/False).

### Notebook 1: Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas

This notebook focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and introduces common techniques used to prepare and understand a dataset before building a model.

#### Key Steps in This Notebook:

1. **Data Importing**:
   - Loading the dataset using Pandas’ `read_csv()` function.
   - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset using `head()` to get an initial look at the data.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and addressing any missing data using `isnull()` and `dropna()`.
   - **Handling Duplicates**: Removing any duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
   - **Data Conversion**: Converting columns to appropriate data types (e.g., converting 'Churn' to a binary column).

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical columns (e.g., 'International plan' and 'Voice mail plan') into numerical values using techniques like Label Encoding.
   - **Creating New Features**: Deriving new features that could be valuable for analysis, such as combining usage patterns into a new "Total usage" feature.

4. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Using functions like `describe()`, `mean()`, `std()`, and `value_counts()` to summarize the dataset and get insights into the features.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Creating various visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to explore the relationships between different features. This includes:
     - **Histograms** to understand distributions (e.g., the distribution of 'Total day minutes').
     - **Bar charts** to compare categorical features (e.g., the number of customers with/without an international plan).
     - **Heatmaps** to visualize the correlation between numerical features (e.g., which features are most correlated with churn).

6. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Analyzing which features most strongly correlate with churn and customer behavior. This helps identify key predictors for the machine learning model.

### Notebook 2: Machine Learning Tutorial for Beginners

This notebook provides a beginner-friendly tutorial for building a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

#### Key Steps in This Notebook:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Making sure the data is clean and free of missing or erroneous values before training the model.
   - **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations using **Label Encoding** for columns like 'International plan' and 'Voice mail plan'.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing numerical features using **StandardScaler** to ensure that features are on the same scale for model training.
   
2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choosing a classification algorithm such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
   - Understanding the pros and cons of different algorithms for classification tasks.

3. **Training the Model**:
   - Splitting the dataset into a **training set** and a **testing set** using `train_test_split()`.
   - Training the model using the **fit()** method on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the model’s performance using metrics such as:
     - **Accuracy**: How well the model predicts churn (true positives and true negatives).
     - **Precision and Recall**: Understanding the balance between false positives and false negatives, which is important for imbalanced datasets like churn prediction.
     - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizing the performance of the model by showing the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
   - Plotting **ROC curves** to assess model performance.

5. **Model Improvement**:
   - Using **GridSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
   - Using **cross-validation** to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

### Data Visualizations and Insights

1. **Churn Distribution**: 
   - Visualizing the proportion of customers who have churned versus those who have not. This helps understand the imbalance in the dataset.

2. **Feature Importance**:
   - Plotting the importance of various features, such as 'Total day minutes' and 'Customer service calls', to understand which factors contribute most to predicting churn.

3. **Customer Demographics**:
   - Visualizing customer features like 'Account length', 'International plan', and 'Voice mail plan' to see how they influence churn behavior.

4. **Churn by Service Usage**:
   - Creating visualizations that show how customer behavior (e.g., the number of calls made, total minutes used) impacts churn rates.

### Technologies Used

- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating visualizations and exploring data patterns.
